# 👩‍💻 Giulia Orlando

Hi! I’m a full-stack developer with several years of experience in large-scale enterprise software, with a focus on scalable front-end architecture, robust validation logic, and clean API integration.

My daily work involves Angular, C#/.NET, PostgreSQL, AWS, and DevOps tooling — but due to strict NDAs, I can’t publish the original source code. Instead, I’m building open-source replicas and sandbox projects that reflect the structure, decisions, and quality I bring to production environments.

While under NDA, here’s the type of work I’ve led or contributed to:

- 🔧 **Refactored enterprise Angular applications** from legacy monoliths to modular standalone components  
- ✅ **Built dynamic validation engines** for complex rule-based forms, shared across multiple business contexts  
- 🚀 **Created and maintained Angular libraries** distributed via AWS CodeArtifact, including automated release and semantic versioning  
- 🧪 **Integrated and tested RESTful APIs** with C# and Postgres backends, including edge-case handling and deep validation logic  
- 📦 **Automated documentation generation** using Swagger pipelines and internal batch tooling  
- 🧭 **Improved code quality** using SonarQube, Lighthouse, and customized ESLint configs  
- 🧩 **Modernized a legacy management platform** by rewriting key visualizations and front-end components in JavaScript and Angular, improving maintainability and user experience across modules  
- 🧱 **Collaborated on the migration of a monolithic Visual Basic system** to a modular web-based stack using Angular, C#, and modern DevOps practices
